Supply chain is undoubtedly a significant determining factor of competitive advantage. Usually, 
the part in which most companies face ineffectiveness is often the supply chain. It involves all 
of the products and raw materials that go into a company to the finished products that go into the 
consumers’ hands. Managing a supply chain effectively require planning, sourcing, making and delivering 
goods which determines their costs and quality in response to customer and market needs. Very often, 
this long procedure involves supply chain elements which are fundamental to the success of any business. 
A survey by Deloitte in 2014 report that 79% of companies with high-performing supply chains achieve 
revenue growth greater than the average within their industries.

Hence, it is clear that the success of your organization is highly interconnected with the productivity 
of your supply chain. Apart from logistical infrastructure and analytics consideration, we cannot overlook 
the most valuable asset which is an engaged and committed workforce for increased productivity in supply chains. 
This is why supply chain training is an essential step to consider. Besides, many other supply chain elements 
are needed to create a successful supply chain. Without those factors, any supply chain has a high probability 
to face obstructions.

Modern industries are embedded with complicated logistics and supply chain systems which is also 
accompanied by a series of management challenges such as, demand management, inventory management, 
order management, warehouse management, resource management etc. These challenges, however, are 
coherent with the advantages of machine learning. The advanced algorithm of machine learning is 
capable of recognizing current patterns of logistics in time and accurately predicts the changings 
in supply and demand. Based on learning data, it can also help to detect potential risks of the 
current supply chain management processes when certain significant factors triggering the ML model.
